This code is part of my master thesis - "Experimental and Numerical Study of Orthotropic Materials"

This Python was used for ABAQUS scripting.
Data from ODB files was extracted through ODB Access module in python. 
This code would analyse ODB data(ABAQUS output file) and modify input to run next simulations ABAQUS. 
This code had saved us time by generating hundreds of simulations automatically.
